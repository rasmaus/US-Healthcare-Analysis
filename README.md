# 🏥 US Healthcare Cost & Demographics Analysis (Excel Case Study)

## Overview

This project analyzes hospital and patient data to study how demographics and admission types influence healthcare costs and outcomes. The goal is to derive actionable insights for hospital resource planning and patient cost optimization.

## Dataset

* Records: 10,000+ patient records
* Hospitals: 100 hospitals
* Attributes: Age, Gender, Medical Condition, Admission Type, Billing Amount, Blood Type, Medication

## Objectives

* Identify most prevalent medical conditions across age groups and gender
* Analyze billing trends to suggest cost optimization strategies
* Study hospital resource utilization patterns

## Key Analysis Performed

* Cleaned and standardized demographic and medical data
* Created age buckets: Young (18–35), Middle (35–60), Senior (60–85)
* Analyzed prevalence of 6 conditions: Arthritis, Asthma, Cancer, Diabetes, Hypertension, Obesity
* Computed average billing by condition and demographic group
* Analyzed admission types (Emergency, Urgent, Elective)
* Conducted time-series analysis (2018–2023)
* Designed multi-sheet dashboards using Pivot Tables and charts

## Key Findings

* Hypertension and arthritis were most common among middle and senior age groups (~40%+)
* Females showed higher obesity and diabetes prevalence
* Males showed higher hypertension rates
* Emergency admissions accounted for ~32% of total cases
* Hypertension required the highest room and doctor allocation (~400+ cases)
* Patient volume peaked in 2020 (~2,040 admissions) during COVID period

## Tools & Techniques

* Microsoft Excel
* Power Query
* Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
* Conditional Formatting
* Heatmaps
* Time Series Analysis

## Deliverables

* Demographic vs medical condition dashboard
* Gender and age group comparison
* Hospital resource utilization analysis
* Admission type trends
* Billing amount insights

## Business Impact

The insights help hospitals improve resource allocation, reduce patient costs, and better prepare for high-demand medical conditions.
